You Need to install win32clipboard, if you don't already have it, you can install it by running: `pip install win32clipboard`

THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PERPOSES ONLY, IF YOU INDEND ON USING THIS FOR THE WRONG PURPOSE I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBlE FOR YOUR ACTIONS, YOU WILL BE DOING SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Code Breakdown
1. `Clipboard Access:`
```python
import win32clipboard
```
The `win32clipboard` module allows you to interact with the Windows clipboard, enabling you to read its contents.

2. `Loop to Capture Clipboard Data:`
```python
while True:
    win32clipboard.OpenClipboard()
    data = win32clipboard.GetClipboardData()
    win32clipboard.CloseClipboard()
```
Inside an infinite loop, the script opens the clipboard, retrieves the current content (`data`), and closes the clipboard.
`win32clipboard.GetClipboardData()` fetches the text content of the clipboard.

3. `Saving Clipboard Data to a File:`
```python
with open('log.txt', 'a+') as f:
    f.write(data + '\n')
```
Each new clipboard entry is appended to `log.txt` along with a newline for easy reading.

Enjoy :)

4. `Sleep Interval:`
```python
time.sleep(5)
```
The code pauses for 5 seconds between each clipboard capture to reduce CPU usage and avoid overwhelming the clipboard with frequent reads
